### Reflection
After a year of Zoom University<sup>TM</sup>, my only goal coming into this quarter was to make new friends in person.
<br>
<br>
And that didn’t happen.
<br>
<br>
Of course it didn’t! I was a shy, introverted, nerd who didn’t know how to hold a conversation nor had any social skills! How could I make friends? And so I didn’t. But reflecting upon the time, I have come to realize is that while those may be true, what really prevented me from making friends was not because I was shy, nor introverted, nor any of the reasons I listed above. It was because I *had* listed the reasons above.[^1] I was so focused on the mindset of “I can’t make friends” that I never tried. And when I cleared that mindset, what surprised me was that, in fact, other students aren’t all that scary. (I know, surprising) Aside from the fact that big lectures were virtually impossible to make friends in since there were hundreds of people, and all that happened is the professor lecturing for an hour without any interaction, and there wasn’t really a chance to talk to people, oh and people rarely even went to lecture (excuses smh) I did get acquainted with many friendly people in my HONORS 100 section.
<br>
<br>
Another thing I learned about in my HONORS 100 section was the plethora of experiential learning activities. After an exciting activity interviewing a colleague and recommending (as well as being recommended) a few experiential learning activities.[^2]  Those activities were quite eye-opening in both scale, scope, and just how many and how wide-ranging they were. I am interested in studying abroad, and very likely will apply to study abroad in a Swiss university next year. I want to further explore not only study abroad but also more of these experiences, resources, and hope to do research as well.
<br>
<br>
Now, this is the last paragraph, so here’s the moment where I reveal to everyone a secret. You see the first sentence of this reflection? The one that says “After a year of Zoom University, my only goal coming into this quarter was to make new friends in person?” Yeah? Well I actually pulled a really cool trick on all of you called *lying*. Nope, that was in no way my only goal (though it was one of my goals) but I though putting that as my first sentence sounded cool. I had plenty of other goals, but one of the biggest ones you can find right on my home page. There’s a biiig word right in front of your face if you navigate to it, which says challenge.[^3] To challenge myself is also one of the things I hope to achieve, both in the scale of this quarter, and during my entire time at UW. The classes I’m taking, as well as finishing extra credit homework, are all me trying to challenge myself and push myself out of my comfort zone. And to be able successfully and continuously to do that, I think, is one of the greatest possible achievements.

## Winter Quarter
some more scaffolding

[^1]: Take a minute. pause. What I just said was really deep.
[^2]: My hands are sore from typing the word activity, and I probably shouldn’t have used it 3 times in the span of two sentences, but that’s something an English major would worry about. As a cool CS major who definitely does things very efficiently, I’m used to repeating phrases – I type `man git` every 2 seconds both because I never remember how flags work, and because I do not know how to use the up arrow.
[^3]: Well, actually it says ./challenge, which is syntax to execute a program on (go back to the top. stop reading this footnote.) the command line while suppressing search in `$PATH`, which is done by the `/` symbol, as POSIX specifies, (GO BACK TO THE TOP! STOP READING) since the current working directory would probably not appear in `$PATH` or else it would be a security flaw. For example, a user can write a malicious version of `man` or `ls` which would run instead of the one in `$PATH`. Thus the ./ represents the way to run a program under this directory. Thanks for coming to my TED talk, which I definitely didn’t paraphrase from stack overflow.
