This was part of what I completed during Dubhacks. It listed out the libraries in UW, and connected to a Google api to retrieve live busyness data. However, there were many challenges to overcome along the way, such as Azure not deciding to cooperate when we tried to deploy a web app, and, as you can probably see, we didn't have time for a proper UI. This experience not only taught me more coding skills but also time management, especially as that weekend I had much more homework than usual.
