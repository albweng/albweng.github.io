At the end of the first half of ACCTG 219, we applied our skills in financial statement analysis to a real-life company, and we chose to analyze Tesla. I thought this was quite interesting for many reasons. We compiled the data and analyzed its ratios. It was eye-opening to see the actual data of how a company operated, and it surprised me that many companies actually don't operate with a profit.
