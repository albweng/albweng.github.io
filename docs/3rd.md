### Reflection
New year, same me, new perspectives. One of the best decisions I made was to take HONORS 230, the national parks class. It was extremely fun and fulfilling to go backpacking outside, and I really enjoyed interacting with my classmates as well as discussing and hearing their thoughts on a bunch of pretty profound and interesting questions, such as what wilderness really is.

Another new thing this quarter was being a TA, which gave me money and I think that that is great. Although grading was pretty cumbersome at times, it was also interesting to see how other people approached homework problems.

As for the STEM-y classes I took, something really interesting and completely unplanned for was how interconnected they all were. Algorithms and Machine Learning both had a lot of linear algebra *basis*, and so did linear optimization. Both Algos and ML also use LPs.

### Artifacts
- [Field Journal Presentation](https://albweng.github.io/3rd/2022/12/08/fieldjournal.html), a culminating final presentation describing all the wonderful experiences I had backpacking in and learning about the national parks.
- Algos Final Presentation, a presentation where we read a research paper and describe its algorithm. I read one of my professor's paper and he asked me how he proved something and I said I didn't know. Also 6 separate people all read the same paper.
- ML Training, a homework where we trained a model and tuned hyperparameters and it sucked because I didn't have a GPU.
